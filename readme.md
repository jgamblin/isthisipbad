# Is this IP Bad?

Is This IP Bad? is a python script that will check an IP against popular IP and DNS blacklists.

## Usage

python3 isthisipbad.py

## Important Notice

*I don't know what I am doing.*

*Update:*  I wrote this code over six years ago as a side project and had not given it much thought. Since people were still using it, it had some errors and bad lists, so I updated it to Python3 and removed offline or bad sources.
